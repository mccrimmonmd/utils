- Forum: real-time chatroom--some public, some private--with no editing, minimal history, and universal speaking privileges; "public square"
- Bulletin: like forum, but non-real-time, public/private and speaking priv.s fully customizable, better for (but not limited to) long-form content, can have editors/be a wiki/etc
- Conference: real-time chatroom where a (changeable) list of pre-approved participants have speaking privileges, and only one person can speak at a time (rules for determining current speaker should be fully customizable, with a default similar to hand-raising).
- Soapbox: one/a small number of speakers address a larger (public or private) audience--content is non-real-time, speakers do not have to take turns (but can indicate they are composing a response to another speaker), content may be vetted and/or edited, and there are mechanisms for taking and answering questions (similar to, but more limited than, typical comments sections). Main difference from Conference is real-time vs. non-real-time.
- ALL: default "speaking" mode is text, but can also be audio/video (including live), images, multimedia, etc.
